There are exploratory data analysis python codes
where I analise a few datasets by first seeing the description of the large dataseta by info, Convert date column to datetime, creating new columns, visulasing 
by plotting them with matplotlib and seaborn, barplot and boc plot.

############# next in Demo_statistics.ipynb ###########################
I analyze an air quality dataset with its statistical properties like mean, confidence_level, z_value, by Calculating  confidence interval. 
I also did some Statistical tests with "Samples with replacement" and applying the central limit theorem and I plot all the statistical distributions.
then I do statistical hypothesis Tests to answer some quastions in the datasets and Compute p-value to detect either the answer lies in null or alternative hypothesis.

############################## in Naive_Bayes_binary_modelling.ipynb ###########################
I use scikit-learn to modeling , made an GaussianNB classifier and study the model-scores. I get the conf_matrix plot and see for false negatives.
I also make DecisionTreeClassifier model and plot the tree and tune depth and samples-leaf, fitted thye models and get the best Avg. Validation Score
